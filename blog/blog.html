          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p class="pb-5">
            At the moment I live in Switzerland in the city of Zurich. The war
            forced me and my family to move from Ukraine. I am a person, I am a
            mother, I am a wife, I am a daughter, I am a friend and I am a
            web-developer. I started my journey not so long ago in the IT field,
            but I have big ambitions. My perseverance, determination and vision
            of the ultimate goal always help me to achieve my dreams in life.
            Therefore, I am sure that I will be able to fully reveal my
            potential in order to change this world for the better.

          <h2>How I created this Web Portfolio</h2>
          <div class="col-4 text">
            <p>
              It took me about five hours to work on the portfolio you are
              viewing now. First, I created the folders and files in them, then
              in each file I wrote the head and necessary links such as
              Bootstrap, CSS and Google Fonts. When I finish with Navbar, I
              decided to also attach a footer where I placed a link to GitHub
              and Netlify. After that, all I had to do - was fill the files with
              content, add media, and adjust the styles. To be honest, I decided
              on a writing style the longest time, but I like this part of the
              job because that's how I can express my creativity.
